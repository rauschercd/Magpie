My mother and I talked last night.
Tell me more about your family.

I said no!
Why so negative?

The weather is nice.
Do you really think so?

Do you know my brother?
Why so negative?

To prioritize things, put them in the getResponse checker in the code as an else if before another keyword. The first one will be prioritized.

When keywords are in another word, such as in "i know all the state capitals", it responds "Why so negative?" because all the computer sees is the "no" inside of "know". Because of the way it checks for things, the computer can give an incorrect answer to certain questions.
